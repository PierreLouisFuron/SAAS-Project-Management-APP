# SAAS Project Management App

This is my take on the SAAS Project Management App from the Udemy course "The Complete Ruby On Rails Developer Course". 

Contrary to the course, it based on Rails 7 and I am not using Milia not any other outdated gem. 
All the multi-tenancy features have been added manually.
